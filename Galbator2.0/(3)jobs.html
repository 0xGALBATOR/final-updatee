            <p data-v-6556558b="">
              For me the collab management is extremely important in the web3
              and in the projects in development because it contributes strongly
              to: the creation of a reputation, according to the collaborations
              carried out, as well as to give visibility and credibility to the
              projects. It is thus one of the essential points to make known its
              project and to attract new members. I have been and am collab
              manager of many projects, with more than 5 months of experience in
              web3. I have a list of more than 180 contacts including strong
              influencers like: Ameer, Kosher, NFTBoi... as well as all
              bluechips like ApeList, DarkLabs, Doodle, CoolCats, CloneX... I
              managed to create very good relationships with many collaborators
              managers which allows me to be fast and efficient in my work.

            <h4>HEAD-MOD / MOD</h4>
            <p>
              The moderation is for me a tool which allows to create relations
              between the staff and the communities and allows especially to
              take care that the community feels in its place and in safety
              within the project. It is also important for the success of a
              project because the moderator reflects for many people the
              seriousness as well as the image that returns the project. I
              started moderating discord more than 3 years ago in many community
              projects and video games which allowed me to gain a very good
              experience and I was a trainer moderator on the biggest French
              discord: 300k members at its peak. I can moderate as well in
              writing as in voice. I've been moderating teams and communities
              for more than a year on web3, I spend about 8-10h a day
              moderating. I can also work under contract if needed.

              I started developing smart contracts and websites within web3
              about 2 months ago, I currently master: HTML, CSS, JS, SASS, REACT
              and SOLIDITY. I haven't had the opportunity to work on a project
              yet and hope to do so soon. I leave 100% control on the visual
              aspect and the construction of the site to the client, I mainly
              take care of coding the site and applying the effects and
              presentation you desire.
